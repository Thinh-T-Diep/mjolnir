				<!-- Personal Information -->
				<h2>Personal Information</h2>
				<!-- Thinh -->
				<p><strong>Thinh</strong>: My name is Thinh, ID: 3825459. I am from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. This is
					my first semester in RMIT Vietnam. I can speak Vietnamese and English. I play Super Smash Bros.
					Ultimate competitively. My IT interest is AI, specifically natural language processing, humanlike
					robots and sentient AI. At the moment, I am an undergraduate student at RMIT in the IT program. I
					have taken classes in programming and computer science and have gotten excellent grades in those
					classes. I have participated in a mentorship program where I have to do research within a team and
					done a presentation at the end. I am confident in my skills in programming and my skill to further
					learn subjects related to IT and computer science. My team name is Mjolnir.</p>

				<!-- Tony -->
				<p><strong>Han Sang Yeob</strong>: Hello everyone! My name is Han Sang Yeob. However, I introduce myself
					as ‘Tony’ in RMIT. I am from south Korea. My student number is S3821179. I can speak Korean, English
					and little bit of Vietnamese. Before joining in RMIT, I have worked around 1 year as a tour guide in
					HCM. I thought that I could learn more things about Vietnam which I really desire to do my business
					in the future. My major was Mechanical engineering design when I was in university in Korea which I
					dropped. Most of the mechanical engineering part was about hardware while my interest was in
					software. I am sure that software would have more demand than hardware in the near future. I love
					drinking coffee in the morning in café and organizing my thoughts. That 30 minutes makes my day more
					productive. When I was in university in Korea, I have done some projects about line tracer, electric
					motor skateboard and IoT using 3D print and Arduino. My programming skills are not advanced like
					other mates, but I am willing to learn happily from my mistakes and my teammate’s feedback. My team
					name is Mjolnir.</p>

				<!-- Nga -->
				<p><strong>Nga</strong>: I am Nga Hoang from Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. I speak Vietnamese, English and
					Mandarin, where Vietnamese is my native language. I commenced RMIT University in Bachelor of
					Business Management in Saigon South Campus in 2016. I spent a year in RMIT Melbourne as an exchange
					student to expand my understanding about the world and expose myself to a diverse cultural
					environment from 2018. My goal in life is to become a financially successful person whilst also
					having freedom to do what I enjoy. I also learn Mandarin because of its potential values in the
					business industry. I enjoy applying what I have learned into everyday situations and discussing or
					sharing my knowledge with other people that I am acquainted with as I think it is a way to
					strengthen your understanding, learn new information and make good connections at the same time. My
					team name is Mjolnir.</p>

				<!-- Thang -->
				<p><strong>Thang</strong>: Hello, my name is Nguyen Quoc Thang, id 3806617. I’m from Hanoi and just move
					in Ho Chi Minh city recently. I’m still adjusting to the new environment here but so far, it’s been
					pretty exciting and fun. I speak Vietnamese and fluent in English (I hope). I’m also the founder of
					a volunteer club in Hanoi (called Youth of Phan Dinh Phung). In my free time, I like to play
					basketball and football. I also very like MMA (Mixed Martial Art) and I’m currently taking an MMA
					class. I can play the piano as well and I really like to watch movies. My favorite director is
					Christopher Nolan. I have taken a few online courses on computer science on codeacademy but I still
					have many thing to learn. I’m really interested in blockchain technology. It has a lot of advantages
					over current technologies such as decentralization, immutability, security, and transparency. I
					believe that blockchain will be the future of global economy. My team name is Mjolnir.</p>

				<!-- Nguyen -->
				<p><strong>Nguyen</strong>: Hello, I am Truong Khoi Nguyen, ID: 3818221. I come from the bustling city
					of Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam. I am currently a student of RMIT University Vietnam, Bachelor of
					Information Technology, which I find to be very fortunate of myself. I can speak fluent Vietnamese
					and English. Apart from writing codes (which I am still learning how to), I spend my free time
					writing songs and let my soul be filled with mesmerizing sound of musical instruments. I really want
					to know more about AI/Deep learning/Machine learning since the concept would occupy the world soon.
					I studied a bit about C++, simple Python, and know the basic principles of PCs’ hardware. Still,
					there is still a long way to go, but I am excited to be where I am right now. My team name is
					Mjolnir.</p>

				<!-- Tuan -->
				<p><strong>Tuan</strong>: Hi, I am Nguyen Anh Tuan and my student ID is 3818169. I was originally born
					in Vinh Long but later moved to Nha Trang and spent most of my time living and studying there. In my
					free time, I usually play computer games and listen to music. My favorite game is CS: GO and I have
					spent more than 2800 hours playing it. Personally, I am interested in the game developing aspect of
					IT. Ever since I was a child, I’ve always wanted to become a game programmer and make a living out
					of it. Currently, I still have little knowledge about coding and diverse facets of IT. However, I am
					taking classes about coding and computer’s hardware and hope that in my 3 years at RMIT, I will be
					able to know more about the IT world and essential skills to help me with my job. My team name is
					Mjolnir.</p>

					<li>Meyers-Briggs: <strong>ENTP (Debater)</strong></li>
					<li>Learning Style: <strong>Auditory learner</strong></li>
					<li><a href="https://bigfive-test.com/result/5dab3773e108cb006217f20c">Big Five Personality</a></li>
				</ul>
				<p>The test I think that is the most useful in this group scenario is the Meyers-Briggs test. I have the
					ENTP type. According to the descriptions, I tend to find the most logical ways to complete a goal. I
					like to think of creative and original solutions for a given problem. I think this information is
					useful when the group hits a wall during the assignment (as it tends to happen during group
					projects), I can help coming up with solutions. I also like figuring things out and finding many
					ways to complete one task (in order to find the best way) so I think I can help steer a team into
					the right direction where I think it’s the best way to complete some goals.</p>

				<!-- Tony -->
				<div><strong>Han Sang Yeob</strong></div>
				<ul>
					<li>Meyers-Briggs: <strong>ENTP (Debater)</strong></li>
					<li>Learning Style: <strong>Visual learner</strong></li>
					<li><a href="http://www.humanmetrics.com/personality/entp">Human Metrics</a></li>
				</ul>
				<p>Personally, I really agree on Meyers-Briggs personality test. For me, I consider future potential
					most important rather than just compromising in the present. I’m happy to take what I am not capable
					of it because I know that I really like taking the risk when comes to decision making. Although it
					might not be satisfied with the result, I know that I got something from the challenging task and it
					helped me getting improve. Based on my personality, I could support my team to challenge new things
					which we might not capable of it. Our teammates might not finish the tasks but I am sure that they
					will gain practical knowledge from it.</p>

				<!-- Nga -->

					<li>Meyers-Briggs: <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/isfj-personality"><strong>ISFJ
								(Defender)</strong></a></li>
					<li>Learning Style: <strong>Visual learner</strong></li>
					<li>Creativity Test:</li>
				</ul>
				<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/nga-creativity-test.png"
							alt="Nga Creativity Test" /></span>For the personality test, the outcome says that I am a
					supporter and that I “seek a frictionless environment, a spirit of friends helping friends to get
					the job done”. I think this is a good point as I look at other members’ results, they belong to
					different personality types and diversity will come with conflicts, which my personality will help
					to alleviate and we all can focus on what really matters. </p>
				<p>Next, the result says my learning style is balanced between visual and auditory. Thus, I can help
					everyone understand and present our ideas effectively and efficiently. Group discussion will also
					help me grasp everyone ideas. Combining with the result from the creativity test, which shows that I
					can work with a large amount of information and manage the relationship between such information, I
					might contribute new ideas to the team based on the collected information. Otherwise, I can find the
					link between that information and make use of it.</p>

				<!-- Thang -->

				<ul>
					<li>Meyers-Briggs: <strong>ENFJ-T (Protagonist)</strong></li>
					<li>Learning Style: <strong>Kinesthetic and visual learner</strong></li>
					<li>Adobe Creative Test:</li>
				</ul>
				<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/thang-creativity-test.png"
							alt="Thang Creativity Test" /></span>I think that the result of all three test is very
					accurate. The Myers-Briggs test and adobe creative test describe exactly my personality. I’m a very
					outgoing and creative person. I see the best in people. When facing with a problem, I always try to
					find the most creative and efficient solution. While most people fear changes, for me, it is a
					chance to gain more knowledge and experience. I really like to challenge myself by setting up big
					goals to accomplish or trying to adapt to new environment whenever I got the chance. This is the
					main reason why I chose to study in RMIT Ho Chi Minh rather than RMIT Ha Noi. The learning style
					test is also fairly accurate. I find myself to study more effectively when I can see examples to the
					problems or when I can actually solve the problem. I’m not the biggest fan of just sitting in the
					theatre and listening to lectures but I’m more excited for real practice in the computer lab.</p>


				<!-- Nguyen -->
				<div><strong>Nguyen</strong></div>
				<ul>
					<li>Meyers-Briggs: <strong>INFP-A (Mediator)</strong></li>
					<li>Learning Style: <strong>Kinesthetic learner</strong></li>
					<li>Creativity Test:</li>
				</ul>
				<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/nguyen-creativity-test.png"
							alt="Nguyen Creativity Test" /></span>I strongly believe that any type of personality can
					always work well together, if one knows who he or she is, and one must have the key factors of a
					teammate: reliability and responsibility. Each person has his or her own way to solve a problem as
					well as advantages and disadvantages. It is good to know the personality of each one, but how you
					deal with it does not really matter to the big picture of teamwork. Finish your task, respect and
					help each other, and you will eventually move forward with your team. With that mindset, I am
					comfortable and confident with my performance within a group project.</p>


				<!-- Tuan -->
				<div><strong>Tuan</strong></div>
				<ul>
					<li>Meyers-Briggs: <strong>ISFP-A (Adventurer)</strong></li>

					<li><a href="https://bigfive-test.com/result/5dc676cee108cb0062181393">Big Five Personality</a></li>
				</ul>
				<p>From my point of view, these test results are quite precise. According to the Myers-Briggs test, I am
					the type of person who has a strong passion, I can spend hour after hour trying my best in what I
					enjoy doing. Furthermore, I am also sensitive to others’ felling, which I can use to encourage my
					teammates when they’re having troubles and minimize conflict between them.</p>

				<!-- Ideal Jobs -->
				<h2>Ideal Jobs</h2>

				<div><strong>Thinh</strong>: AI Researcher</div>
				<div><strong>Tony</strong>: IoT Developer</div>
				<div><strong>Nga</strong>: Operation Manager</div>
				<div><strong>Thang</strong>: Cybersecurity Manager</div>
				<div><strong>Nguyen</strong>: AI/Deep learning/Machine learning Engineer</div>
				<div><strong>Tuan</strong>: Game Developer</div>

				<!-- Compare Ideal Jobs -->
				<br>
				<h4><i>Compare and contrast the ideal jobs for each person in the group. What common elements are there,
						if any? What differentiates each position from the others, if anything?</i></h4>
				<p>Our group ideal jobs are very diverse. Each people seem to be interested in a different field: IoT,
					Cyber security, Gaming, AI, Business and different position from low to high: researcher, developer
					to even manager. Although it may feel like our jobs have nothing in common but there are actually
					some compulsory requirements that we all have to satisfied. All of our jobs need a lot of practical
					experience. School does not directly teach essential skills for the real world like teamwork, time
					management, decision making, ... These types of skills are ones you can only learn in a working
					environment, not in a classroom. Moreover, Practical experience can help you to get ahead in the
					competitive job market. Getting any kind of work experience will help you to stand out from other
					applicants. Our group ideal jobs will also require basic understanding of computer technology and IT
					infrastructure. As we are at the beginning of industry 4.0, almost all the jobs are now somewhat
					related to digital technology (cloud computing, IoT...). In order for employees to work more
					efficiently, they must know how to use and utilize their company IT infrastructure and technology.
					Apart from this, our ideal jobs are very different from each other. Some jobs like game developer or
					AI researcher will have a better time looking for work outside of Vietnam. In other developing
					countries, gaming is a billion-dollar industry and AI is being focused on because of its convenience
					and useful practice in many fields. But in Viet Nam, Gaming is a young industry and AI is still a
					very new technology. Some of our jobs like cyber security/operation manager or AI engineer need
					higher qualification (PhD, master), experience than others. Often Business, IT professionals gain or
					improve some of their most marketable skills through a master's degree program. Many universities
					have worldwide partnerships with corporations, studying a master program will also provide the
					opportunity to gain international experience and travel to several different countries to gain
					insights from leading global experts.</p>


				<!-- Compare Career Plans -->
				<br>
				<h4><i>How similar or different are your career plans across the group?</i></h4>
				<p>Overall, everyone has a plan to pursue their dream jobs. The similarities among these career plans
					are most of us want to graduate with a high GPA, self-study on technical skills and self-develop
					soft skills. As a bachelor’s qualification is a minimum requirement for almost all positions, our
					career plans include that and with distinction or higher degree. Moreover, as all positions require
					experiences and technical knowledge, we all encompass the self-study factor, which we will get the
					specific knowledge by ourselves beside the courses in university. For examples, many members want to
					learn various coding languages through courses online in their own time. Although we could not have
					on-the-job experience while studying, we all came up with the same idea of either internship or
					joining projects and researches before graduation. This will not enough to alternate real
					experiences but to give us an idea, a preparation for future work. Further, this kind of activity
					will also target soft skills, such as critical thinking, team working, communication and human
					skills, which are also a pattern in the requirements.</p>
				<p>Our career plans also have some differences. First, some career plans state to pursue higher
					education to increase the chance of getting the job. Thinh and Nguyen’s plans mentioned their
					intentions to further study of getting master’s and PhDs qualifications. Second, some of the
					positions have more prospect of growth overseas rather than Vietnam. IT fields like AI and IoT have
					more room to grow and learn in a globalized context. This is also why most members believe that they
					want to belong in an international company or work outside of Vietnam when they get the job.</p>
