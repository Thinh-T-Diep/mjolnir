				<p>The main software that is necessary for the systems to work seamlessly is Artificial Intelligence, or
					AI. AI will be needed for the computer vision and the food recommendation function. Since we are not
					technically knowledgeable enough to make or simulate these functions, we decided that thorough
					research and literary review will be done for this part. We will come up with proposed ways we can
					use the current technology to achieve the goals for the fridge functions, mainly focusing on the
					computer vision function.</p>
				<p>In our research, we have identified a key technology that will be used in our computer vision
					technology: deep learning. Deep learning is a technology that enables such functions such as
					classification of images. Using the cameras that are placed inside the fridge, it can take images of
					the food as it being put inside the fridge and while it stays there. It can then, for example,
					identify if a piece of beef or pork has been put inside the fridge. Based on a few metrics such as
					color, it can then classify the piece of meat as fresh or not and calculate the time it has left
					still being useable. Combined this with information such as the time it has been put inside the
					fridge, it can then do things such as notify the user that they should use the item soon (more
					details in the app section). A test with real images, however, is yet to be performed for this
					functionality.</p>
				<p>We have yet to be able to implement the image classification algorithim. However, we have done a
					prototype for a secondary function of the fridge, which is the door opened notification system that
					would notify your app if you have left the door open for a set period of time. This function will be
					useful in preserving the energy usage of the fridge, as well as preventing the food being spoiled as
					a result of door being left opened.</p>
				<p>For this function, we implemented it using Arduino IDE (Arduino 1.8.10), which could be downloaded on
					the main Arduino website without any additional fee, as one of the main methods to develop the code
					and upload it to the microcontroller. Another approach is to use Arduino Web Editor, again, is
					provided with no charge on the main Arduino website, to store our code on their cloud and use it as
					a backup in case if needed. Although Arduino Web Editor is free, an account is needed to use it. We
					also use an Arduino simulator to test our code and debug it, this simulator is available at
					TinkerCAD.com and it’s completely free of charge.</p>
