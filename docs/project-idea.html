				<h4>Team Project Idea</h4>
				<h1>Smart Fridge</h1>
				<h2>Eliminating food waste from the source.</h2>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/fridge-schematics.png" alt="Fridge Schematics" /></span>
				<p>Combining all our project ideas from assignment 1, our group came up with the project idea of a smart
					refrigerator. The motivation of this project came from the problem of food waste around the globe.
					Food waste is a huge problem for both developed and developing countries. One of the ways that food
					is wasted in households is that families buy more food than they can consume within its expiration
					duration. This smart fridge aims to alleviate this root cause. </p>
				<p>The main function of the smart fridge is detecting different food that is put into the fridge. The
					fridge can detect different information about the food such as which kind of food (meat, vegetable
					etc.), its expiration date, whether it is cooked or raw, and other information. The fridge can do
					this by making use of <strong>computer vision systems</strong> and <strong>biometrics
						sensors</strong>. By placing cameras inside the fridge, the fridge can <u>collect images</u> of
					the food that are placed inside the fridge. An <strong>AI algorithm</strong> can <u>analyze the
						images</u> and provide information like what kinds of food it is. <u>Biometrics sensors</u> that
					are placed
					inside the fridge work in the same way, they <u>collect data such as chemicals being released by the
						food</u> inside the
					fridge. The <strong>AI algorithm</strong>
					can then analyze this data to provide information such as <u>whether some fruits are ripe based on
						the amount of ethylene being detected</u> inside the fridge. The user of the fridge is not
					required to perform any other actions than what they are already doing, such as putting the food in
					their fridge. The fridge is connected to an app that display the information that the fridge has
					gathered. In addition, it could inform the temperature and humidity inside of the refrigerator by
					using temperature and humidity sensor which will be placed inside. The app also provides more
					functions that help the users manage their food such as reminding them some usual food, like eggs or
					milk, has run out, or suggesting meals that can be cooked some soon-to-be-expired food. It will help
					user to shop in the market because this product has camera and motion sensor which could take
					snapshot when the user wants through the app.</p>
				<p>The main technological fields that this project is related to is Internet of Things and AI. The
					fridge and the app are connected to each other to create a system that help the user manage food. AI
					is necessary to make it possible that the fridge knows what kind of food is put into it, or what
					meals can be made from available ingredients.</p>
				<p>It is also interesting to note that big consumer appliance companies such as Samsung and LG had made
					such fridges before, but all of them were commercial failures. It would be interesting for us to
					learn more about these products and learn why they failed, and what can be improved if our project
					were to be a commercial product.</p>
				<p>A prototype of this fridge that is suitable for our team technical skill levels can be a IoT box that
					can detect if something is put inside it (simulating the function of the fridge detecting some food
					is put inside it). Another prototype we may make is the companion app user interface. This prototype
					app can display information about some food.</p>
