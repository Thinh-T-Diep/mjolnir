				<!-- Problem -->
				<h2>The Problem</h2>
				<p>The motivation of this project came from the problem of food waste around the globe. Food waste is a
					huge problem for both developed and developing countries. One of the ways that food is wasted in
					households is that families buy more food than they can consume within its expiration duration. This
					smart fridge aims to alleviate this root cause. Moreover, compare to normal refrigerator, energy
					consumption is lower due to applying application to manage amount of energy that it consumes during
					users are not using.</p>
				<!-- Aims -->
				<h2>The Aims</h2>
				<p>We outline <strong>the one vision</strong> for our project: provide a way to reduce food waste that
					is convenient and
					affordable. As discussed briefly in the Motivation introduction of the project, food waste is a
					global problem, and therefore requires a solution at the mass level. There are three keywords in our
					mission statement. They are “reduce food waste”, “convenient” and “affordable”. Each of these
					attributes is essential to solve our original problem. Each of these keywords will be discussed
					below with a goal for each of them.</p>
				<p>Firstly, <strong>“reduce food waste.”</strong> Our proposed project is a fridge with smart utilities.
					For many
					consumers, this may come across as a cool, new or fun product that is more technically advanced than
					the other ones on the market but is not different than any other fridges. It is therefore important
					for the team and the consumers to be educated that our aim is not trying to apply advanced
					technology in a fridge for the sake of technology, but we are trying to solve a global problem that
					is food waste. The smart utilities that the fridge will have will all revolve around this aim. The
					most important one is that it provides a way for consumers to keep track of the food in their
					fridge, so food does not go to waste. There will be supplemental functions in the product that
					complement this main utility. The functions are discussed in detail in the scope and limits section
					of the report.</p>
				<p>Secondly, <strong>“convenient.”</strong> In many environmental messages, a version of the following
					statement can be said “If everyone does this little thing, this problem would be eliminated.” The
					reason that this does not work for most people is that the alternative environmentally friendly
					product or solution is not as convenient or as good on the personal level for the consumers than the
					one they are already using. For example, it is widely known that plastic bags are not
					environmentally friendly, but it is hard to deny its positives: cheap, small, lightweight, and most
					important of all, does not require the shopper to bring their own bags. Therefore, it is impertinent
					that the alternative solution that we are offering does not require the consumer to fundamentally
					change their behaviors. When a person comes back home from grocery shopping, they put in the food in
					their fridge and no more steps are required. We want this to be the experience that the user of our
					fridge will have. They only need to put the food in the fridge and the fridge will take care of
					things for them. It will keep tracks of the food, remind them of soon-to-be-expired items et cetera.
					More will be discussed in Scopes and Limits section.</p>
				<p>Lastly, <strong>“affordable.”</strong> One of the reasons environmental movement often does not reach
					mass adaptation is because they are much more expensive than the current solution. For example, if
					stores provide paper bags instead of plastic bags for shoppers, because of the higher price of paper
					bags, costs will be reflected on the items for sale itself, creating a business problem. Therefore,
					it is important that our solution is affordable. Since a fridge is often a large purchase for a
					household, there are a wider margin that our team can work with to reduce cost. The main way that
					the fridge could be less expensive is that the materials of the fridge is optimized and researched
					thoroughly.</p>
